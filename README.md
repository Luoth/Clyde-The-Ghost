# Clyde-The-Ghost

A Game-Dev project with the goal of creating an arcade-game with a 'twist'.

Made in the KineticJS library.

The final concept was a Pac-man inspired chase-game for 2 players. 
One controlling 'Clyde' the other controlling 'Larry'.

Larry is quick, and has to run away from Clyde for a set amount of time, he can also gather points along the way
by touching any of the 'candy' pieces which are scattered across the map.

Clyde is a slime-monster so he's sluggish and slow. His only goal is to catch Larry, which he can do by shooting slime.
The slime will slow Larry for a few seconds if he touches it.

Larry wins if the time runs out.

Clyde wins if he catches Larry.

What went right?:

Interaction with the artists - At first it took some time to come up with an idea we all liked, 
and some of our previous ideas got scrapped. So we weren't all too keen on the concept at first. 
Whenever us developers needed an asset, we would get it within an hour, de Artists did really well when they needed to
without any delay, so I'm happy about that.

Concentration on the project - It's easy to stop working, and just go play games or do some other crap at any moment
when you've got a powerfull laptop in front of you. But I made sure that didn't happen, and we  still had tons of fun.
Erwin and me were working on the game every moment that we were in the work-area, and I even thought about the game
at home. Constantly thinking about how we were going to tackle the problem we had at that given moment, and what 
still needed to be added and what could get scrapped (and we scrapped A LOT!). And that felt great!

What went wrong? (/ went badly):

Stupid logic with developing - Erwin and me were still learning, so we made some stupid mistakes. We thought way too
complex for some mechanics, thinking we were doing it the right way and not realising that there were easier options.
For example: We made a timer, which counted up each frame, and then after 50 frames (game ran at 50FPS), it 
counted down 1 second on the timer, which then did some other crap and yeah.. it was a very foolish solution, but it worked!
And when we look back now we still laugh at it.
